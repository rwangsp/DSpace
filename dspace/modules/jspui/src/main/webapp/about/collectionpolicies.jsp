     <h1 align="center">TSpace Repository Policies and Guidelines</h1>
<p>University of Toronto&rsquo;s research repository, TSpace, is built through partnerships between the University of Toronto Libraries and the University of Toronto academic communities to disseminate and preserve the scholarly record of the U of T faculty and students. As in any partnership, it is important that each stakeholder understands and agrees to the policies, guidelines, and procedures required to build TSpace. The following policy statements have been developed with input from TSpace stakeholders.</p>

<h2 id="submitters">1. Authorized Submitters</h2>
<p>Any member of the University of Toronto community can submit materials to TSpace, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual faculty members and librarians</li>
<li>Faculties</li>
<li>Departments</li>
<li>Research teams</li>
<li>Administrative units and associated staff members</li>
<li>Graduate students, with faculty sponsorship</li>
<li>Undergraduate students, with faculty sponsorship</li>
<li>Researchers at other Canadian institutions using the <a href="http://www.carl-abrc.ca/advancing-research/institutional-repositories/adoptive-repositories/">CARL Adoptive Repositories Program</a> (in consultation with the UTL)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="content_guidelines">2. Content Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>The work must be authored, produced, or sponsored by U of T faculty</li>
<li>Submissions must be scholarly, research, or pedagogical materials (e.g. manuscripts, journal articles, books/book chapters, conference presentations, theses and dissertations, etc.)</li>
<li>The work must not be ephemeral; deposits are intended to be permanent contributions to the repository</li>
<li>The work should be final and complete (e.g. papers that are ready for publication or have been published, books or book chapters that are complete on their own)</li>
<li>The work should be ready for public dissemination in open access environment immediately upon submission or after an embargo period</li>
<li>Related works (e.g. sets or series) should be submitted together where possible</li>
<li>All works must be submitted in a manner consistent with Canadian Copyright law: i.e. the author must have copyright, permission from a rights holder, or must avail themselves of one of the permitted uses of copyrighted content in the Copyright Act of Canada</li>
<li>For each submission, one or more file(s) must be uploaded that will be assigned a permanent URL (a handle). Links to external websites or standalone pages can be included in addition to the file(s) but cannot be the only source of content, since TSpace cannot guarantee long-term access to external pages</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="formats">3. Format Support</h2>
<p>TSpace strives to provide support for as many file formats as possible and to ensure that files are preserved as is using best practices for digital preservation. However, when it comes to specific formats, the proprietary nature of many file types makes it impossible to guarantee their preservation. Put simply, our policy for file formats is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything put in TSpace will be retrievable</li>
<li>We will recognize as many file formats as possible</li>
<li>We will support as many known file formats as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>When a file is uploaded to TSpace, we assign it one of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supported</strong>: we fully support the format</li>
<li><strong>Known</strong>: we can recognize the format, but cannot guarantee full support</li>
<li><strong>Unsupported</strong>: we cannot recognize a format; these will be listed as "application/octet-stream," or Unknown</li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind, it is recommended to choose &ldquo;supported&rdquo; file formats over &ldquo;known&rdquo; or &ldquo;unsupported&rdquo;, where possible. For the current list of format and level of support see our <a href="/help/formatsupport.jsp">Format Support page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="license">4. TSpace License</h2>
<p>Authors/copyright holders or their designated representatives submitting materials to TSpace must agree to a non-exclusive distribution license which allows the University of Toronto to reproduce, distribute, and migrate the submitted work to new formats where necessary and feasible.</p>
<p>Granting the license is different from transferring copyright. Copyright is never transferred to TSpace. Rather, by granting the non-exclusive license, copyright holders permit the University to distribute their work while retaining the right to pursue any other publishing ventures.</p>

<h2 id="structure">5. TSpace Structure and Stakeholders</h2>
<p>TSpace content is organized around Communities, which generally correspond to administrative entities such as faculties, schools, and research institutes or other groups that produce research. Communities may contain Sub-Communities and Collections to reflect the structure of the unit and the nature of research conducted. Repository submissions and content management may be carried out at individual (submitter), Collection, Sub-Community or Community levels. In the absence of a Community/Collection administration, content is managed by TSpace staff.</p>

<h2 id="withdrawal">12. Withdrawal and Modification Policy</h2>
<p>TSpace has been established to create permanently accessible digital record of the U of T scholarship. TSpace non-exclusive distribution license grants a license to the university to keep copies of deposited items available for purposes of preservation and access. However, the University of Toronto Libraries foresees times when circumstances may warrant modifications or withdrawals of deposited items. This can be done at the following levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modifying item description.</strong> Errors in item metadata may be corrected by TSpace staff on request.</li>
<li><strong>Modifying a TSpace item.</strong> Since any TSpace item that has existed at some time may have been cited in its original form, modifications are only permitted in the form of updated versions posted alongside the original documents.</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawing a TSpace item.</strong> TSpace is intended to provide persistent public access to deposited material. As such, requests for withdrawal are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and must include a justification for the request. An option to temporarily withdraw (embargo) an item may be considered where warranted by circumstances.
<p>Requests for withdrawal/embargo of theses and dissertations should be directed to the <a href="http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/Producing-Your-Thesis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">School of Graduate Studies</a>; all other requests should be directed to <a href="https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/feedback">TSpace staff</a>.</p>
